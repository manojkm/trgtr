                        Insightist UG, which is a fully owned private limited company
                        under Global Learning Ventures UG, Berlin, Germany.
                        TRGTR curates and distributes customised contact details
                        of professionals from publicly available sources. This
                        comprises of three distinct processes: data sourcing, data
                        processing and data distribution.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Data Sourcing:</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Our proprietary techniques equip us to extract unstructured
                        business, financial and academic data from publicly
                        available professional sources and social handles. We focus
                        on the contact data of specialists, not the behavioural
                        attributes.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Data Processing:</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                    We sort, collate and aggregate the data generated by our
                    processes and combine it with the data sourced from more
                    than hundred data vendors from around the world. The
                    aggregated data is validated before and after classification.

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Data Distribution:</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                    The systematically processed data is classified into tailormade
                    packages as required by the clients who use the
                    database for marketing leads. Our packages are typically
                    tailored according to monthly plans. Besides the monthly/
                    annual plans, we are equipped to provide customised bulk
                    packets as well (contact us if you need bulk packets).
